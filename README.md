Statistical Analysis:
  - Manually recorded the 2nd and 4th toned notes from 10 song samples, entering each tone's slope value according to pitch analysis
  - Used slopes to make box and whisker plot
  - B&W plot shows IQR and quartiles, used to calculate cutoff for outlier data
  - Used slopes to make histogram
  - Histogram shows dsitribution of (non-outlier) slope values across the 10 songs
